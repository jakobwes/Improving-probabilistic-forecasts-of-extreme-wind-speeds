# Improving-probabilistic-forecasts-of-extreme-wind-speeds

This repository includes code for the paper "Improving probabilistic forecasts of extreme wind speeds by training statistical post-processing models with weighted scoring rules".

The main analysis and experimental code can be found in `analysis.ipynb` (see [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/jakobwes/Improving-probabilistic-forecasts-of-extreme-wind-speeds/blob/main/analysis.ipynb) in nbviewer to view online). The code for the synthetic experiments in section 7 of the paper can be found in `Synthetic Experiments.R`. 

Packages required:
- numpy
- scipy
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- tqdm
- Only for section 5.3 of the paper: pytorch
